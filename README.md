This project was made for the video game Cryptmaster, released May 9, 2024 on Steam. This is a personal project, and is not in any way affiliated with the game
 or its developer. I take no credit for the game itself, or the idea, or anything like that. This was made for my personal use and I'm trying to avoid any kind
 of legal trouble here, if such a thing exists.

In the game, you control four characters - Joro, Syn, Maz, and Nix. The game is incredible, but I've had trouble working with the main mechanic of the game,
 discovering the 'memories' and 'skills' of the various characters in a pseudo-Hangman game. This project was meant to aid me with that, and is rather rudimentary.
 Clicking on a letter in the bottom grid will blackout the corresponding letters on the characters' own personal grids, to represent the letter being 'guessed'.
 Once the current word has been guessed, simply click the 'Reset' button on the appropriate character's box to reset the list of possible letters to guess for
 the current word.
